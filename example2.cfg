Take the distance from a box to all targets that doesn't have a correct box
divide it by number of targets

for all 
Manhattan distance 


 basically the average length for a box to targets.
 
• h1 = the number of misplaced tiles. For Figure 3.28, all of the eight tiles are out of
position, so the start state would have h1 = 8. h1 is an admissible heuristic because it
is clear that any tile that is out of place must be moved at least once.

• h2 = the sum of the distances of the tiles from their goal positions. Because tiles
cannot move along diagonals, the distance we will count is the sum of the horizontal
and vertical distances. This is sometimes called the city block distance or Manhattan
distance. h2 is also admissible because MANHATTAN all any move can do is move one tile one step
DISTANCE
closer to the goal. Tiles 1 to 8 in the start state give a Manhattan distance of
